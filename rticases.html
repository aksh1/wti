				<h5><b><u>RTI by agent of Indian Militiary Intelligence</b></u></h5>
				<p>For 61-yr-old Kishori Lal Sharma, a former agent of the Indian military intelligence, the years between 1966-1974 was spent in various jails of Pakistan. 
				After promise made for financial aid by Punjab government, nothing was done. 
				As a final resort, he filed an application under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, asking the Deputy Commissioner about the status of his case. 
				Sharma did this through the group of youngsters who had organized a 15-day RTI awareness camp at Model Town Extension. Currently Sharma has started work in a private firm and now lives in BRS Nagar. 
				He says “the government did not provide any financial help since then and at 32 I had to make a fresh start. I was lucky. Because of my professional qualifications, 
				I managed to get a job. But even after the announcement by CM in September, 2005, nothing has happened. Perhaps RTI can be a ray of hope for me.”</p>

				<h5><b><u>Official Fined Rs 18000 under Info Act</b></u></h5>
				<p>In the second incident of penalising an erring officer under the Right to Information Act in Madhya Pradesh, Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) T N Shrivastava fined Morena District Woman and Child Development Officer (DWCDO) Sajan Aluna for failing to provide information sought under the Act within the time limit and not abiding by the appellate officer's order.
				The CIC imposed the fine of Rs 18,000 after not being satisfied with the explanation given by Mrs Aluna, who was earlier given show cause notice on the second appeal by Mr. Balwant Singh Haihayavanshi, who had sought certain information from the department on December 31,2005. 
				A fortnight ago, Tahsildar R S Chouhan of Gyaraspur in Vidisha district was fined Rs 25,000 for refusing to provide copies of land transfer deed to an applicant under the Right to Information Act.</p>

				<h5><b><u>RTI For School Uniform</b></u></h5>
				<p>When students of Gulrahai Primary School in Allahabad did not receive their school uniforms in December 2006, nine parents filed an RTI application questioning the administration about the missing uniforms, which led to school dresses being delivered in the first week of January, 2007. Parents of a government school in Chitrakoot, Uttar Pradesh, also procured school uniforms by filing an RTI application.</p>

				<h5><b><u>RTI Breaks the Nexus</b></u></h5>
				<p>The Right to Information (RTI) has emerged as a powerful tool that can be used to hold governments accountable. Besides resolving issues of everyday life, it also helps in influencing major government policies. This self-empowerment story of Arif and Zamila Banu reads “I bought a flat two and a half years back in my wife’s name. After I bought the flat, the builder gave me a copy of the registry. But I found out later that I needed to get a transfer copy and a blueprint for the flat. I went back to the bank officials, but they said that all the papers had been given. I had prior knowledge of RTI and that is how I filed one in my wife’s name. I sent this RTI to an officer in the RBI. I received a call within five days from the bank. They asked me about the harassment I had faced. I told them everything. After which they told me that I would have all my paper work done by the next day. Sure enough, by morning, all my papers were with me. With the help of RTI, I broke the nexus of the bankers and builders who were making me run around. I appeal to all my fellow citizens to understand the power of RTI. We must remember that all these government officers are answerable to us,” said Arif.</p>

				<h5><b><u>70 year old uses RTI to get records of her son's death</b></u></h5>
				<p>A 70-year-old woman from Haryana has used the Right to Information Act to gain access to files regarding the pension and other benefits of her son, a Delhi Traffic Police constable who was killed in a road accident over five years ago. Laxmi Devi of Bhiwani district in Haryana had appealed to the Central Information Commission (CIC) for gaining access to file notings made by authorities on her son’s dossier regarding the payment of terminal benefits totaling about Rs. 4 lakh and his family pension. The CIC’s ruling giving her access comes amidst a controversy over a government proposal to amend the RTI Act to prevent the public from viewing most file notings. Laxmi was left penniless after her son Anoop Singh’s death on January 29, 2001 as her daughter-in-law Mamta, who was drawing the family pension, re-married in August 2005, her petition said.</p>

				<h5><b><u>Public Distribution Scam in Assam</b></u></h5>
				<p>In 2007, members of an anti-corruption non-governmental organization based in Assam, the Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti, filed an RTI request that revealed irregularities in the distribution of food meant for people below the poverty line. The allegations of corruption were probed and several government officials arrested.</p>

				<h5><b><u>IIM's Admission Criteria</b></u></h5>
				<p>Vaishnavi Kasturi a visually-impaired student, in 2007 was denied a seat in the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore, one of the country’s premier management institutes – despite her impressive score at the entrance examination. Ms. Kasturi wanted to know why, and wondered whether it was because of her physical disability. She filed an RTI application to request the institute to disclose their selection process. Although she failed to gain admission to the institute, her RTI application meant that IIM had to make its admission criteria public. It emerged that the entrance exam, the Common Admission Test, actually mattered little compared to Class 10 and 12 results.</p>

				<h5><b><u>Chandigarh-Smoke Free City</b></u></h5>
				<p>In 2007, Chandigarh became the first smoke free city in India, which meant banning smoke in indoor spaces as well as prohibiting it in outdoor public places likes parks and markets. But Hemant Ghosh didn't expect his RTI applications to lead to such a landmark decision, which would influence other cities to enforce smoke-free laws in the years to come. Soon after the Act came into force, Ghosh inundated the governments of Punjab and Haryana with over 300 queries on how The 2003 Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA),which sets out provisions to address smoking in public places, was being implemented in their shared capital. According to the 2003 law, his application asked whether the ‘No Smoking Area Smoking here’ is an offence warning was displayed in offices and premises under government control." In 2007, 1,800 "warning boards" appeared in all government departments, police stations, hospitals and schools city a smoke-free one, only 78 persons were challaned (fined) in an entire year," he said.</p>

				<h5><b><u>Adarsh Society Scam</b></u></h5>
				<p>The applications filed by RTI activists like Yogacharya Anandji and Simpreet Singh in 2008 were instrumental in bringing to light links between politicians and military officials, among others. The 31-storey building, which had permission for six floors only, was originally meant to house war widows and veterans. Instead, the flats went to several politicians, bureaucrats and their relatives. The scandal has already led to the resignation of Ashok Chavan, the former chief minister of Maharashtra. Other state officials are also under the scanner.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<h5><b><u>Appropriation of relief funds</b></u></h5>
				<p>Information obtained through an RTI application by an NGO based in Punjab, in 2008 revealed that bureaucrats heading local branches of the Indian Red Cross Society used money intended for victims of the Kargil war and natural disasters to buy cars, air-conditioners and pay for hotel bills – among other things. Local courts charged the officials found responsible with fraud and the funds were transferred to the Prime Minister’s Relief Fund.</p>

				<h5><b><u>Pen Mightier then Sword</b></u></h5>
				<p>The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act or Right to Education Act (RTE), is an Act of the Parliament of India enacted on 4 August 2009, which describes the modalities of the importance of free and compulsory education for children between 6 and 14 in India under Article 21A of the Indian Constitution.[1] India became one of 135 countries to make education a fundamental right of every child when the act came into force on 1 April 2010.</p>

				<h5><b><u>Diet Allowance Increased</b></u></h5>
				<p>The state Cabinet on Tuesday accepted a proposal to increase the amount of DIET allowance to every indoor patient of every category of government hospitals from Rs. 25 per patient to Rs. 50 per patient. A proposal to set up separate State Scheduled Caste/Schedule Tribe Commissions on the pattern of the National Commissions for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was also approved by the cabinet. It also accepted the draft of Bihar Right to Information (Amendment) Rules 2009. An applicant will now have to file separate application to get information on different matters. He will get only one information on one application. The Cabinet also sanctioned a compensation of Rs. 1 lakh each to all the 16 farmers killed at Amausi village in Khagaria district on October 1 this year in a massacre.</p>

				<h5><b><u>Common Man Empowered</b></u></h5>
				<p>For the past 15 years Sanjay Kumar Pandey, a resident of Rakhial in Ahmedabad, was forced to live with drinking water shortages, bad roads and a non-existent drainage in his area. After being a silent witness for long, he decided to act. He filed a Right to Information (RTI) application regarding the state of basic civic amenities in his municipal ward. His application, however, was rejected by the authority concerned. Sanjay decided to appeal in the State Information Commission. Although there were 3,500 appeals pending at that time, it did not deter him and he patiently waited for his turn, which came after one and half years. During the appeal proceedings, he was called six times and the authorities did not have replies to his questions.</p>

				<h5><b><u>Towns Missing in the Map</b></u></h5>
				<p>For the two villages that had fallen off the development map and were infamous for their violent conflicts, it's been an impressive turnaround. Taking the help of the Right to Information (RTI) Act, a determined group of youngsters have changed the negative narrative of Moch, a two-village panchayat in Chhattisgarh's Bilaspur district, into a positive script — greater political accountability, transparency and social change. Earlier, elected officials avoided the area. "The conflicts and clashes, mostly caste-based and political, were so frequent that the administration was forced to set up a police chowki here," said Shiva Dhruve (35), a resident of Moch, the larger of the two villages, around 140 km east of Raipur. The light at the end of a seemingly endless tunnel came in the form of a campaign by the NGO Chhattisgarh Citizens' Initiative.</p>

				<h5><b><u>Food Grains rot in godown</b></u></h5>
				<p>Heaps of food grains are rotting in Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns across the country due to apathetic attitude of the authorities concerned, reveals a right to information (RTI) query. The finding shows that as on Jan 1 this year, 10,688 lakh tonnes of food grains were found damaged in FCI depots, enough to feed over six lakh people for over 10 years. Between 1997 and 2007, 1.83 lakh tonnes of wheat, 6.33 lakh tonnes of rice, 2.20 lakh tonnes of paddy and 111 lakh tonnes of maize were damaged in different FCI godowns. "The FCI godowns have enough space to store food grains properly. Yet the grains are rotting in open spaces on their premises while millions are starving. It's a national shame," said Dev Ashish Bhattacharya, who filed the RTI application on January 6, 2010.</p>

				<h5><b><u>Woes End</b></u></h5>
				Besides losing dealership, the ration shopkeeper was also forced to pay poor families in the village over Rs. Four lakh, the cash equivalent of the grains he had sold illegally. Revat Ram and his friends used the Act to get all records of their ration shop in Himmatsar village and by exposing how grains meant for the poor were being black-marketed at a ration shop in Bikaner district.
                After the move the villagers got the dealer removed. ‘’Earlier we used to be afraid that if we speak against the Sarpanch, he will not give us jobs under drought relief. But now we feel bolder and think that through the new law we can put an end to his frauds,” said a local resident. And now it seems people across Rajasthan are keen to use their information rights. Bunglings have led to 15 sarpanches being removed and a dozen officials suspended.

				<h5><b><u>2G Scam</b></u></h5>The 2G scandal involved the Telecom Ministry, led by Andimuthu Raja, undercharging mobile phone companies for frequency allocation licenses, allegedly for bribes, which ended up costing the Indian government Rs1,76,645 crore. As the scam unfolded over months, the RTI helped to uncover how the rot spread in the Congress Party led government. An RTI application filed by Subhash Chandra Agrawal, for instance, revealed that Raja had a "15-minute-long" meeting with then Solicitor- General Goolam E. Vahanvati in December 2007 following which a “brief note was prepared and handed over to the Minister," but no minutes were recorded.</p>

				<h5><b><u>Diversion of Funds</b></u></h5>
				<p>An RTI application filed by the Housing and Land Rights Network, a non-profit, which revealed that the Delhi government had diverted Rs744 crore from social welfare projects for the Dalits to the Commonwealth Games.
                The diversion of Dalit funds during the CWG triggered further investigations. Using budget documents and RTI, the National Coalition For SCSP-TSP Legislation, an umbrella organization of Dalit and Adivasi groups, figured out that a staggering 5,27,723.72 crores worth of funds had been denied to Dalits and Tribals from the seventh to twelfth five year plans in the Union Budget.

				<h5><b><u>When Hunger Goes Unanswered</b></u></h5>
				<p>Wastage of an amenity as basic as food, in a country where price rise has forced around 230 million citizens to go hungry on a daily basis, is a sad truth. The Food Corporation Of India (FCI), in reply to an RTI query sought by a city-based activist Om Prakash Sharma, has revealed that not less than 1,94,502 metric tonnes of food grain worth crores of rupees was wasted in India due to various reasons between March 2005 and March 2013. The RTI filed by Mr. Prakash reminded the Indian citizen to take note of the food wastage being one of the reasons leading to the inexorable price rise in India , as well as the initiatives takes by the Government to prevent the same. The report revealed that the amount of  the damaged stock in 2012-13 has lessened in comparison to that in the previous financial years. It is all the more necessary to build up a pressure on the Government with the help of such RTIs so as to remind it it’s responsibility over the general public which now can demand for answers whenever it wants to.</p>

				<h5><b><u>Public kept in Dark?</b></u></h5>
				<p>The Nirbhaya Rape case of 2011 lead to the  awakening of the general public that forced  a deep crack in the glass of the Indian Judicial System, lacking a backbone of women security and clear judgment. The revolution against the evil-doers made it seem as an end to the crimes against women or rather to the delay in judgments. In reality ,the situation has not changed. RTI in this case, acts as a powerful tool to look at the real picture. Vihar Dhurve, a pune-based RTI activist sought to know from the apex court the details of pending rape and harassment cases in the Supreme Court which have been assigned to fast track courts. In response, the apex court said "there is no fast track court defined and year-wise pending matter in regard to  subject category is not maintained." Over 300 cases of sexual harassment were pending before the Supreme Court and over 400 cases of kidnapping and abduction were yet unattended by the apex court. In addition to the crimes against women, the RTI reply revealed that 472 cases of corruption were also pending before the apex court.</p>

				<h5><b><u>You must live on streets, for all houses belong to MPs</b></u></h5>
				<p>The reply to the RTI filed by Vijay Purswani, a resident of Bhopal, once again left open the favoritism of the politically sound, towards their relatives in the capital city of Madhya Pradesh. The chief Minister of the state, Mr. Shivraj Singh Chouhan   was questioned when the RTI revealed that he passed on the costly plots in the capital to his relatives at dirt cheap rates. Purswani told the Economic Times that the allotments were made after denying possession certificates to those who had already paid several installments for the land. Chouhan’s steps towards corruption positioned him in the list of leaders who were already known to have snatched away the rights of the general public to favor their loved ones.</p>

				<h5><b><u>COMEDK Seat Scam</b></u></h5>
				<p>An RTI was filed, addressed to the Karnataka government seeking information regarding the student admissions in MBBS program, based on CET selection methods. According to the official records, the available seats for MBBS in the colleges of Karnataka were being filled through the Karnataka Examination Authority. But the documents received in the reply to the RTI query narrated a different story. According to those documents, in the academic year 2012-13, many students got seats in the government colleges without attending the CET selection procedure. The COMEDK seat scam was an example of the fraudulent means of the exercising government for its objectives of favoritism.</p>

				<h5><b><u>Our Money,in such a State?</b></u></h5>
				<p>Banks are the economical backbone of a country, trusted by the citizen for the security of its hard-earned money. The state-controlled banks are trusted better than the private ones But, sadly, frauds in both kinds of Banks has led to a heavy loss to the Government. An RTI filed in early 2014, by the Economic Times, has revealed that the cases of fraud has lead the Indian Banks to lose as much as Rs. 17,284 crore. Many of these cases are being investigated by the CBI or the state police. Although private banks account for about 75% of the total number of cases registered, these lenders lost Rs 970 crore while the state-run banks lost as much as Rs 16,314 crore during the year. In comparison, all banks put together lost Rs 4,448 crore to frauds during 2011-12.  The RTI query has revealed that the initiatives taken by the Indian Banks Association (IBA) have not succeeded in preventing the frauds in the economy.</p>

				<h5><b><u>India,my Coy Mistress</b></u></h5>
				<p>The RTI has been of major help in seeking information in the field of India’s foreign relations and the Indian army. An RTI filed in 2014, addressed to the Defense Ministry of India revealed that 54 Indian Soldiers who were captured in the wars of 1965 and 1971 are still believed to be in Pakistani jails. The Ministry forwarded the RTI query to the Ministry of External Affairs in order to seek response. The MEA revealed the names of the PoWs but decided to keep shut when asked for the reasons of its failure in their release. It is a strange fact that the Ministry could not succeed in freeing our soldiers inspite of the fact that Pakistan lost the war in 1971. The soldiers of Pakistan captured by India were released in the 1973 agreement by Pakistan. Such a revelation has stressed upon the need for The Ministry of Defence to look into such a matter. A Tri-Service Committee has been formed in the ministry of defence to look into the matter, it said. It is a shameful failure for India to have not acted in this direction as yet.

				<h5><b><u>Vyapam</b></u></h5>
				<p>The scam involved 13 different exams conducted  by the Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board  ,( or Vyapam – Vyavasayik Pariksha Mandal), for selection of medical students and state government employees (including food inspectors, transport constables, police personnel, school teachers, dairy supply officers and forest guards). The exams were taken by around 3.2 million students. RTI helped in various ways in getting the insights of the scam and the un-layering of the events. According to the information received after an RTI query in 2015, it was revealed that the board conducted admission tests for National Law Institute University (NLIU), enlisted only the roll numbers of the students that made into the merit list ,and not their names. Ajay Dubey , the ‘whistleblower” in the scam (who filed the RTI query) , opined that this was done to safeguard the interests of the beneficiaries .According to the RTI reply Dubey received , Sandhya Srivastava, former finance officer at Vyapam and the prime accused in the multi crore scam,was given a clean chit by Ranjana Chaudhary, on recommendation of Pankaj Trivedi, former controller of examinations at vyapam. This revelation forced the CBI to file an FIR against Trivedi on grounds of forgery, under the IT Act, Prevention of Corruption Act and the Madhya Pradesh Recognised Examination Act.</p>

				<h5><b><u>Maharashtra – Yet not a clean governance?  RTI reveals the inside story</b></u></h5>
				<p>Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013, commonly known as The Lokpal Act, is an anti-corruption Act of Indian Parliament in India which "seeks to provide for the establishment of the institution of Lokpal to inquire into allegations of corruption against certain public functionaries and for matters connecting them". India, in its recent years, had fought tremendously for the implementation of the Lokpal Bill. After the bill was given assent in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha in December, 2013, it was expected for all the states to appoint their Lokayuktas and start functioning accordingly, as soon as possible. For the states which never had a Lokayukta were given 1 year as a time-frame, for the appointment of the same. For others, no stipulated time was decided .Although Maharashtra was the first ever state to appoint a Lokayukta in 1971, the position had always remained non-functioning. An RTI filed in late 2015 by Jeetendra Ghadge, revealed that even after two years that the Lokpal Act was brought into force, Maharashtra government had not yet implemented it. Although its government appointed a Lokayukta in August, 2015 ,its clean functioning remains. "It seems that the Lokayukta appointed under the guidelines of the new act won't see the light of the day in the state. It has been over two years now and the Maharashtra government has been indecisive," Ghadge said.</p>

				<h5><b><u>Glamour can destroy, to save itself!</b></u></h5>
				<p>Had there been a middle class man, who drove relentlessly in his drunken state killing another, sleeping on the footpath and injuring four, he would have to go through a tremendous amount of physical and mental torture until he would complete his punishment. Here we have, the superstar Salman Khan, who is known to be the convict under the Hit and run Case, but roams about freely because of the inefficiencies of the State to function properly in His case. A city-based RTI activist Mansoor Darvesh sought to know from the state Law and Judiciary department the names and the total number of counsels, solicitors, advocates and legal advisors, public prosecutors appointed by the state government for this case. The reply given to him by the state revealed that the files concerning this case were burnt and destroyed in a fire at the Mantralaya. This is a blatant example of the inefficiency of the State government of Maharashtra. The police and the Government have failed to keep up their promises of recovering and restructuring the lost documents so as to reach an ethical conclusion. If a fire at the State Secretariat can destroy documents as important as these, it is hard for the general and non-bias public to trust those who are responsible for justice. </p>
